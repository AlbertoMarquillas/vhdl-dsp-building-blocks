# ex12 — DDS/NCO via Vivado IP

This exercise uses the **Xilinx Vivado DDS Compiler IP** to implement a 32-bit NCO (sine/cosine).
- **Clock (Fclk):** 100 MHz
- **Target frequency (Fout):** 40.7 MHz
- **Phase increment:** phase_inc = Fout * 2^32 / Fclk = 1,748,051,689

## Integration notes
- The IP provides **cos(θ)** and **sin(θ)** outputs.
- These are suitable for I/Q mixing in a QPSK modulator.

## Repository policy
Tool-generated files are **not included** (non-portable):
- `.xci`, `.bd`, `.bda`, `.ui`, and Vivado project caches/runs.

If you need to synthesize the design with Vivado:
1) Recreate the **DDS Compiler** IP with the parameters above.
2) Connect the IP to your top-level as in the original project.
3) Use the provided **testbench** (`tb_ex12_dds_nco.vhd`) for simulation.

## Simulation
This repo ships only the TB. The actual HDL for the IP is regenerated by Vivado.
